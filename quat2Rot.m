%Function name: quat2Rot
%Returns a rotation matrix R given a 4X1 vector of Quaternions

%[R] = quat2Rot(Q)
%cpMap(): Calls the cross product matrix
%Sq is the real part of the quaternion

%R = the rotation matrix describing rotation for a given roll, pitch, yaw
% Q is the 4X1 quaternion vector
