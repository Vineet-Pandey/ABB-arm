%Function name: twist2Transform
%Returns homogenous transformation matrix for a given 6x1 twist vector
%[H] = twist2Transform(t)
%Twist vector is mentioned in the following format:
%[v w_t]
%v is taken to be the first 3 rows of t; w, theta are found out from w_t
%rotation matrix 'R' for the rotation angle theta,about axis w is found out
%the translation vector 'd' is found out from v using the inverse of the
%inverse formula 
%w_t is the angular rotation obtained from the twist
%w is the normalised angular rotation 
%H = the homogenous transformation matrix describing transformation
%t = input 6x1 vector of the form [v, w_t], where w_t = w*theta and v is
%related to the translational vector
%t1, t2 & t3 are the 3 terms in the equation relating V and d
